Each time I click on any cell in the last row it should add a row. But what happening is when I click first time on any cell of last columns nothing happens then if I click on any cell in the Table, it adds a row. Here is the complete description of the bug on stackoverflow that I discussed with Mr Shai Almog-\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29144983/issue-in-dynamically-adding-row-to-the-table-and-setting-value-to-the-cells\n\n<b>What version of the product are you using?

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when a component is added to the animated Container whilst an animation is already registered.\nThe XXX is thrown when it accesses the motions array for a component which did not yet exist when the animation was registered. \n\nit does this continuously because the animation never finishes because of the exception. \n\nI suggest that the animate() method should be wrapped in a try-catch block and that the animation is cancelled in case of an exception.\n\nI also suggest that the animate() method only iterates over as many entries as the motions array contains - use motions.length instead of componentCount. Either this or - another solution was to integrate the new component(s) in the animation by extending the animations arrays.\n", "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"]}, {"created": "2015-03-27 16:34:00", "commits": {"41b81b01d44f77ada29336bb6799e42ce015866f": {"commitGHEventType": "referenced", "commitUser": "shannah"}, "d406a5e1e93cd87f170e8ac7ee053334ff0d91f6": {"commitGHEventType": "referenced", "commitUser": "shannah"}, "d5d11486dbb5e4d6a4e93fefe8332d00e10c411d": {"commitGHEventType": "referenced", "commitUser": "shannah"}}, "numCommits": 3, "closed": "2015-04-23 22:05:38", "filteredCommits": ["41b81b01d44f77ada29336bb6799e42ce015866f", "d5d11486dbb5e4d6a4e93fefe8332d00e10c411d", "d406a5e1e93cd87f170e8ac7ee053334ff0d91f6"], "commitsDetails": [{"nameRev": "41b81b01d44f77ada29336bb6799e42ce015866f remotes/origin/Version-3.1~38", "commitMessage": "Fix for regression with showing text fields in iPad on iOS 7.

Unfortunately that prevents me from creating a test case.\n\nThis is a regression, this function was working with the new iOS VM. Now that the file imports seem to be working fine, I can no longer use the network connection.\n\nWhen I run my application on my iPod it seems to run into a problem at the same point every time, however the symptoms are different, sometimes it will lock up, sometimes it will crash.\n\nBuilding the generated source code on Xcode, I see the same problem and again sometimes it locks up, sometimes it crashes. When it locks up Xcode shows memory use is constant and the CPU is running at 5%.\n\nWhen it crashes it is on the assert in the following method:\n\nvoid initMethodStack(CODENAME_ONE_THREAD_STATE, JAVA_OBJECT __cn1ThisObject, int stackSize, int localsStackSize, int classNameId, int methodNameId) {\n# ifdef CN1_INCLUDE_NPE_CHECKS\n\n```\nif(__cn1ThisObject == JAVA_NULL) {\n    THROW_NULL_POINTER_EXCEPTION();\n}\n```\n# endif\n\n```\nmemset(&amp;threadStateData-&gt;threadObjectStack[threadStateData-&gt;threadObjectStackOffset], 0, sizeof(struct elementStruct) * (localsStackSize + stackSize));\nthreadStateData-&gt;threadObjectStackOffset += localsStackSize + stackSize;\nCODENAME_ONE_ASSERT(threadStateData-&gt;callStackOffset &lt; CN1_MAX_STACK_CALL_DEPTH - 1);\nthreadStateData-&gt;callStackClass[threadStateData-&gt;callStackOffset] = classNameId;\nthreadStateData-&gt;callStackMethod[threadStateData-&gt;callStackOffset] = methodNameId;\nthreadStateData-&gt;callStackOffset++;\n```\n\n}\n\nI have some basic logging built into my app and it shows that we are connecting and receive the first few segments of the data, then it either hangs or crashes at the         networkManager.addToQueueAndWait(_connectionRequest);\n\nHere is the log from a crash:\n\n2015-02-18 13:30:40.992 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:8,514 - SENT: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.739 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,261 - RETURN FROM: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.740 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,262 - DATATYPE=text/html\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.742 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,264 - DATALEN=78336\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.742 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,264 - Parsing data\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.843 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,365 - Parsed data\n2015-02-18 13:30:41.938 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,460 - SENT: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.278 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,800 - RETURN FROM: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.279 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,801 - DATATYPE=text/html\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.280 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,802 - DATALEN=79384\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.281 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,803 - Parsing data\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.378 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,899 - Parsed data\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.462 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:9,984 - SENT: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.696 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,218 - RETURN FROM: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.697 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,219 - DATATYPE=text/html\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.698 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,220 - DATALEN=82062\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.699 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,221 - Parsing data\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.813 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,335 - Parsed data\n2015-02-18 13:30:42.903 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,425 - SENT: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.164 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,686 - RETURN FROM: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.165 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,687 - DATATYPE=text/html\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.166 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,688 - DATALEN=79459\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.167 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,689 - Parsing data\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.265 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,787 - Parsed data\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.367 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:10,889 - SENT: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.575 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,97 - RETURN FROM: GETROWS\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.577 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,99 - DATATYPE=text/html\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.578 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,100 - DATALEN=80939\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.580 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,102 - Parsing data\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.692 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,214 - Parsed data\n2015-02-18 13:30:43.783 AWMain[3323:33647] [null] 0:0:11,305 - SENT: GETROWS\nAssertion failed: (threadStateData-&gt;callStackOffset &lt; 256 - 1), function initMethodStack, file /Users/mcw/rware/Projects/AW/dist/AWMain-src/nativeMethods.m, line 955.\n(lldb)          \n\nThe thread stack in Xcode seems to show a recursive malloc.

This seems to be a regression of some kind as I was able to get a lot further in my app before the changes discussed in issue 1339.\n\nMy app creates a database, closes it, reopens it and displays the contents in a list. My app is now consistently crashing after the load. My app also lets users switch between databases, if you select a database, I close the old one and open the new one. Again it crashes immediately. This is all new.\n\nI have tried to create a test app to reproduce this. It is very hard to do. These GC issues are not related to specific functions, it all seems dependent on timing and what else is going on in the app. Trying to extract the key code from a much larger app, changes all the timings. I have created a test app that crashes on my Ipod 5G, my iPad Mini and when running the generated source code in Xcode. I am not 100% certain it is the same bug, but the device crash logs are very similar and in both cases are in the same CodenameOne function:\n\nJAVA_VOID java_lang_String_releaseNSString___long(CODENAME_ONE_THREAD_STATE, JAVA_LONG ns) {\n    if(ns != 0) {\n        // this prevents a race condition where the string might get GC'd and the NSString is still pending\n        // on a call in the native thread\n        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n            NSString\\* n = (NSString*)ns;\n            [n release];  (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) here\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nHopefully if you can fix the crash in this test app, it will fix the crash in my app too. If not would it be useful to send you the build generated source code for the full app? As it crashes in Xcode, you could build it there. Let me know if you want me to do that.\n\nIn order to run this app you will need to set the property ios.fileSharingEnabled to true and you will need to copy the sample data file to the app on your device using iTunes.\n\nThe code and test file are attached.\n\nBuild and run the app. Hit Start, then Load.

Whenever I try to edit a Textfield and write into it, the app freezes. Only happens on iOS, not on Android nor simulator.\n\nI have been able to narrow down the problem and create a test case. Steps to reproduce the problem.\n- Create a Form with a Tab Container\n- In one Tab, do the following:\n  \n  Create a BoxLayout Y Container and make it ScrollableY\n  \n  Place a TextField into it\n- In the other tab, just add a List (no need to attach any Renderer to it)\n\nAnd that\u00b4s it. The app will freeze if you try to write in the TextField.\n\nI have only tested with the old vm, so I don\u00b4t know if it is reproducible with the new one.

done over the network but can also be done with a file copied to the device. Either way if the dataset is a small one, my apps work. However larger datasets consistently crash the new VM.\n\nIn trying to narrow down the problem and create a test case I have come to the conclusion that it is not a particular operation that is causing the crash but the load.\n\nThe sample program attached will read lines from a file and run them through your CSVParser. It crashes before completion. In order to run this app you will need to set the property ios.fileSharingEnabled to true and you will need to copy the sample data file to the app on your device using iTunes.\n\nThis app runs fine on the old VM, it also runs a lot faster on the old VM, it takes about 18 seconds to complete. On the new VM it takes 38 seconds to crash without completing.\n\nThis initial data load is key to my apps and so I can't really test my apps at all on the new VM because I can't get any data to them.\n\nI have attached the sample program, the data file you will need to run the program and the crash log I received from my iPod.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 16:13:16", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1303", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-High", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Sample program to crash ios.newVM"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 16:09:06", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1303](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1303) created by codenameone on 2015-01-23T12:21:52.000Z:\n\nPlease clearly state whether the issue relates to a device/the simulator or the tools.\nDevice - iPad Air\n\n<b>If related to a device be sure to specify exactly which device with as much</b>\n<b>details as possible.</b>\niPad Air, iOS ver 8.1.2 - newVM\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1.

My app is running displaying a progress bar, then I am back on the home screen.\n\nI cleared out all the logs from my device. Then I ran my app to reproduce the problem.

So I think that for case when long is expected another callback method should be used -&gt; callback.longToken(..).\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:55:20", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1254", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Bug in JSONParser: always parse numbers as double even if long is expected"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:55:01", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1254](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1254) created by codenameone on 2015-01-02T20:14:41.000Z:\n\nI have a project with two packages: a free and non-free version.

Also on Android and with the old vm, code is working correctly.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly causes the nullpointerexception, but I guess it's the calendar.add call. However, without the for loop, it looks like it works OK.

Please first view the video at:\n\nhttp://nisfl.ddns.net/vsc/ShouldNavigate.MOV\n\nWithin the CN1 BrowserComponent, initiate non-HTML javascript URL Redirect using javascript i.e. window.location.href=&quot;sometext&quot;; \n2. Use shouldNavigate to catch the non-HTML window.location.href text and process in CN1\n3. works fine in Android 4.4.2 and below, all IOS devices and the Simulator\n4. In Android 4.4.3 and later, the device html engine briefly displays an error message saying something to the effect of &quot;Web Page Not Found&quot;. This only lasts for a second or two, then the CN1 shouldNavigate takes over and the error page disappears.\n\nThe error message appears whether the text of the window.location.href is valid HTML or not. Even if I've built a valid html page on my server an put the server and page URL in the window.location.href, I still get the same error.\n\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nIn Android 4.4.2 and below, the 'Web Page Not Found' error does not appear. The CN1 app code takes the text from the window.location.href and processes it accordingly. The error also does not appear in any (so far) iOS devices. The error also does not appear in the Simulator (Mac OS 1.9.4, java 7 Update 67)\n\nWhat should happen is that the CN1 app shouldNavigate() receives the text from the javascript window.location.href and processes it depending on what the text is (per app code) without getting any error messages.\n\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nError appears on Android 4.4.3 and greater.\n\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nThe shouldNavigate() DOES do what it is supposed to do in Android 4.4.3 and above. The problem is the brief error message that should not be appearing before the shouldNavigate() takes effect.\n\nThis happens consistently on a Moto X running Android 4.4.4 and a Nexus 7 running Android 4.4.4. While the Nexus 7 had Android 4.4.3, the same error appeared. When the app was first installed on the Nexus 7, it had Android 4.4.2 and the error message did not appear. Prior to the Moto X upgrading to Android 4.4.4, it was using Android 4.4.2 and never saw that error message.\n\nNote that the Google Android page discusses changes in Android 4.4.3 relating to this very situation:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/migrating.html\n\nSample javascript used:\n&lt;script&gt;\n$(window).scroll(function() {\n        if($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() == $(document).height()) {\n            window.location.href=&quot;lawtech:www.ag-p.com/last/&quot;;\n        }\n        if($(window).scrollTop() === 0) \n            window.location.href=&quot;lawtech:www.ag-p.com/first/&quot;;\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf this can't be fixed, some other way of communicating from javascript back to the BrowserComponent is needed for Android 4.4.3 and above.\n", "closed": "2015-04-06 20:19:28", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1169", "ttf": 10.000277777777777, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Android 4.4.3 and greater give 'Web Page Not Found' error in response to javascript shouldNavigate()"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:43:17", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1169](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1169) created by codenameone on 2014-08-18T11:49:39.000Z:\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. build and deploy AppArgBug CN1 application (sources attached) on an Android device\n2. open the application - there is a label with AppArg text - will be NULL_VALUE, because the application was not opened by URI scheme\n3. open a web page (in firefox, because the newest chrome does not call URI scheme, but the exact application)\nhttp://android.alucid.eu/help/q.html and click the PEIG - TEST link -&gt; this will open the AppArgBug application with the AppArg property value in label or only white page - if the first one, continue with 4\n4.

openOutputStream(file,offset) to open a file in writting at a given offset but it always fails with a &quot;java.io.FileNotFoundException&quot; error.\nWhereas if I use the openOutputStream(file) function, all is working well.\nThe file of course already exists and I call the function with an offset inferior or equals to the length of the file.\n\nI should also say that strangely, the path returned by the getAppHomePath() function is not &quot;/Users/username/.cn1&quot; as it should be, but &quot;file://home&quot; (but if I create a file in the directory returned by getAppHomePath(), it would appear in &quot;/Users/username/.cn1&quot; on my computer. So somehow, &quot;file://home&quot; seems to be an alias to &quot;/Users/username/.cn1&quot; for the simulator). So maybe my problem is linked to this strange behaviour (the alias may not be recognised by the openOutputStream(file,offset) function like it is by the  openOutputStream(file) one?)\n\nI am using the eclipse plugin on a PC with windows 8.1    \n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:36:24", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1125", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "FileSystemStorage.openOutputStream(file,offset) failing in simulator"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:35:48", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1125](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1125) created by codenameone on 2014-05-13T13:52:58.000Z:\n\nWhen using URI scheme to run an application, the calling uri is passed through AppArg property (Display.getInstance().getProperty(&quot;AppArg&quot;, null)). \n\nHowever, this property is set only when the application is created and not when it is already in memory and so is (only) resumed.\n\nI attach a demo application (the whole CN1 eclipse project without JavaSE) which registers itself to receive URI scheme alucid://callback. When the app is invoked, it writes out the calling url (i.e. calls Display.getInstance().getProperty(&quot;AppArg&quot;, null)).\n\nI also created a demo web site, which generates such URIs: https://android.alucid.eu/help/q.html\n\nUnfortunately on android it seems to work, because the browser starts the app as inside itself and when the browser is run again, the testing application is destroyed and created again (so it is not the onResume scenario).\n\nYou have reproduce it on iOS - the application remains in background there. \n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Deploy the attached CN1 problem on iOS (iOS7)\n2. Open http://android.alucid.eu/help/q.html in a iphone's web browser and click the link.\n3. The AppArgBug application opens and writes out the url.\n4. Go back to the browser, refresh the page (it generates new uri link) and click the link\n5. The application should write different URI, because new was generated, but the old one is written out (because the AppArg was not reset).\n\nAnother scenario: If you whenever null the AppArg property in the code (Display.getInstance().setProperty(&quot;AppArg&quot;, null)), then it is removed forever - after being called by URI scheme, empty label is added.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:36:17", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1124", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "AppArg property not updated when app is resumed"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:35:46", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1124](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1124) created by codenameone on 2014-05-08T13:30:09.000Z:\n\nIt would be great if in addition of using the mouse to navigate the menus to take a screenshot there would be a shortcut key for that menu (any of the F1,F2..Fn keys)\n\nSometimes I need to take a screenshot in the middle of an action that is using the mouse and by the time I move the mouse to the menu to take the screenshot the action is already finished.\n", "closed": "2015-04-09 09:48:33", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1123", "ttf": 12.000277777777777, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "RFE: Add short function key (f1,f2,f3..) to screen capture on the simulator"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:35:35", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1123](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1123) created by codenameone on 2014-05-04T00:51:48.000Z:\n\nWith no other changes than updating to the latest JavaSE.jar.\nIn the simulator there were dramatic changes in the way buttons are being displayed (Text even turned blue).

Since some platforms (namely iOS) don't actually render onto the graphics at the time of the call, it would be handy to be able to add a callback that would be called at the time of rendering.\n\nThe API could work as follows:\n\npublic interface NativeRenderCallback {\n    public static enum Pipeline {\n        IOS_CORE_GRAPHICS,\n        IOS_OPENGL_ES_1,\n        IOS_OPENGL_ES_2,\n        ANDROID_CANVAS,\n        etc...\n\n```\n}\n\npublic void render(Pipeline pipeline);\n```\n\n}\n\npublic class Graphics {\n\n```\npublic void addNativeRenderCallback(NativeRenderCallback){\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nThe usage might be something like:\n\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g){\n\n```\n...\ng.addNativeRenderCallback(new NativeRenderCallback(){\n\n    public void render(Pipeline pipeline){\n\n        if ( IOS_OPENGL_ES_2.equals(pipeline) ){\n\n            callSomeNativeMethodThatUsesOpenGLES2();\n\n        }  else if ( IOS_CORE_GRAPHICS.equals(pipeline) ){\n\n            callSomeNativeMethodThatUsesTheCoreGraphicsContext();\n        }\n\n    }\n});\n```\n\n}\n\nOn the CodenameOne side of things, a NativeRenderCallback would either be wrapped in \nan executable op that is added to the pipeline (in the case of iOS), or, if the \nmode is immediate drawing (e.g. Android or IOS mutable image grahics drawing), the render() \nmethod would just be called immediately.\n\nI realize that this gives use developers a lot of rope to hang ourselves, and modules\nthat depend on too many implementation details of the underlying port are subject to\nbreak if the CN1 core is changed, but I think that it is worth the tradeoff.\n\nHaving this sort of access will make it much easier to add to CN1's graphics abilities \nincrementally.\n\nIf you are OK with this, I can make the changes myself.  It would only require adding a few lines of \ncode in CodenameOne implementation and the iOS port.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:25:26", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1045", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "NativeRendering callback"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:25:11", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1045](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1045) created by codenameone on 2014-01-18T18:58:25.000Z:\n\nFiling an issue as a reminder of the promised new function, getHintLabel()\n\nSee formu post: https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/codenameone-discussions&amp;showsearch=true&amp;showpopout=true&amp;hl=en&amp;parenturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.codenameone.com%2Fdiscussion-forum.html#!searchin/codenameone-discussions/hint/codenameone-discussions/qoCX3F5jNpU/gI1F7P6y2N8J\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:25:15", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1044", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "getHintLabel()"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:25:00", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1044](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1044) created by codenameone on 2014-01-18T06:02:41.000Z:\n\nHi,\n\nI created a project in codenameone its working fine Android and IOS\nbut when i deploy this project for blackberry in am getting Null Point Exception.\n\nPlease reply.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:25:09", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1043", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Null Point Exception for BlackBerry"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:24:54", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1043](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1043) created by codenameone on 2014-01-17T19:10:50.000Z:\n\nCurrently the implementation of nextPowerOf2 on iOS calculates an extra power of 2.\n\nCurrent implementation:\nint nextPowerOf2(int val) {\n    int i;\n    for(i = 8 ; i &lt;= val ; i *= 2);\n    return i;\n}\n\ne.g. nextPowerOf2(256)  produces 512\n\nI suggest changing it to\nint nextPowerOf2(int val) {\n    int i;\n    for(i = 8 ; i &lt; val ; i *= 2);\n    return i;\n}\n\nThat way if val is already a power of 2 we don't need to grow anymore.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 15:24:58", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1042", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "iOS nextPowerOf2 needlessly goes one power too far"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 15:24:48", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 1042](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=1042) created by codenameone on 2014-01-17T10:39:05.000Z:\n\n<b>Please clearly state whether the issue relates to a device/the simulator or</b>\n<b>the tools.</b>\n<b>If related to a device be sure to specify exactly which device with as much</b>\n<b>details as possible.</b>\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1.

This is because it always keeps the same map center point before, during, and after the zoom operation without any regard to where the pinch zoom is actually occurring.  This means that if the person is not pinch zooming directly in the center of the map, they will be taken to a completely different part of the map when the pointer is released.\n\nBelow is a diff that fixes this issue by keeping making sure that the coordinate of the pinch zoom (or at least the middle of it) remains in the same pixel position before, during, and after the pinch zoom operation.  \n\nI have tested this on the simulator and iOS.... I believe this covers all of the possible code paths (both for fast mutable images and slow mutable images).  It yields a marked usability improvement.\n\n```\nIndex: com/codename1/maps/MapComponent.java\n===================================================================\n--- com/codename1/maps/MapComponent.java    (revision 1690)\n+++ com/codename1/maps/MapComponent.java    (working copy)\n@@ -73,6 +73,8 @@\n     private int scaleY = 0;\n     private int translateX;\n     private int translateY;\n+    private int zoomCenterX = 0;\n+    private int zoomCenterY = 0;\n     private static Font attributionFont = Font.createSystemFont(Font.FACE_PROPORTIONAL, Font.STYLE_ITALIC, Font.SIZE_SMALL);\n\n     /**\n@@ -200,7 +202,11 @@\n             }\n             g.translate(-translateX, -translateY);\n             if (scaleX &gt;

This does not cause the app to crash right away, but text manipulation in a label does! After the sound has stopped, I go to a second form which has a text field.

option for generating native interfaces does not generate a JavaSE stub, nor is a JavaSE stub supported even if added manually.  When developing native libraries that are intended to work cross platform, it would be very helpful to be able to generate native stubs that will work on JavaSE as well (i.e. in the simulator) so that the library's functionality won't be crippled when running inside the simulator.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a feasible workaround for this either.\n\nI'm happy to try to solve this problem myself and contribute the fix, but I think this fix involves modifications to the build server so I don't think I'm able to.\n\nAs I know you are busy, I understand that this may take a long time to be completed.

I have just added some cleanup functionality to be able to free Javascript object references that are no longer needed.  Previously any Javascript object that is wrapped by a JSObject java object has a reference stored in a global lookup table array (in the Javascript runtime).  This array lives until the browser page is reloaded, or the browser component is destroyed.  For most small cases this isn't an issue, but if complex components are created that are long-lived, it could accumulate a lot of Javascript objects in this array.\n\nI have added a sort of automatic reference counting mechanism now to be able to clean up stale references so that the Javascript GC can free them.

For my offline builds of iOS I have been using full resource path structures for quite some time... I just updated my offline build project to do this too.  I do it by not letting XMLVM deal with the resources at all.  Instead I add a runscript build phase to the Xcode project that copies the resources into the bundle during the Xcode build step, maintaining the directory structure.\n\nRelevant portions of my offline build script are as follows:\n1. Copy all resources from the class path into a resources directory.\n      &lt;copy todir=&quot;${xcoderes.path}&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src&quot; excludes=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;\n          &lt;fileset dir=&quot;lib/impl/cls&quot; excludes=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/copy&gt;\n2. Do the XMLVM build normally.\n3. Add the runscript build phase to the xcode project:\n       &lt;exec executable=&quot;/usr/bin/php&quot; dir=&quot;${buildscripts.path}&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;arg file=&quot;${xcodeadd.path}&quot;/&gt;\n          &lt;arg file=&quot;${xcodeproj.path}/project.pbxproj&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/exec&gt;\n\nThe ${xcodeadd.path} variable refers to a PHP script that actually does the processing of the xcode project and adds the runscript.  I have attached the script for reference.  Ultimately it just adds the following 1-line runscript:\n\ncp -r &quot;${PROJECT_DIR}/../resources/&quot; &quot;${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}&quot;\n\nJustification for this change:\n1. One of the strengths of Java is its namespace ability.  Without the ability to also include complementary resources for Java libraries it limits the potential of third-party libraries.\n2. Specific case is for libraries that wrap BrowserComponents and provide HTML-based components.  We need to be able to embed stylesheets, images, html files, and Javascript files - or if &quot;need&quot; is too strong a word, it is much nicer to be able to embed these things without having to encode them into a Java class.\n3. Eliminate possibility of conflicts.  WIth third party libraries, even if they just use a flat directory structure, there is potential for conflicts if two libraries use resources with the same name.\n\nPossible Pitfalls:\n1. Optimization and Obfuscation.  Currently unused java classes and methods are stripped out of the resulting binaries which helps to keep the binary size to a minimum.  Resources don't naturally conform to this type of optimization so if the CN1 core gets bloated with lots of resources, it will result in the application binaries growing larger whether or not the additional resources are used.\n   \n     Solutions:  \n         a. Don't use resources in the CN1 core.  They are still very useful for external libraries.  That way application developers can opt to use the library only if they need it.  Thereby not bloating their application with unneeded resources.\n        b. Require CN1 classes to declare which resource directory trees they depend on using either an annotation or some other method.  Then use s proguard (or similar) as a preprocessing step to strip out resources which are not needed.\n   \n   ```\n    (I think solution a is perfectly fine and it doesn't require any special development).\n   ```\n2. Consistency across platforms.  If we make this change to iOS, then what about Windows Phone, Blackberry, J2ME, and Android?  \n       Solution:\n         I would propose that all platforms should retain directory structure of resources.  Android already does.  I haven't tried Windows Phone but I'm sure a similar solution to the iOS solution would not be difficult to create.  I presume since JME and Blackberry are built on Java that they already retain directory structure of resources.\n3. Backward compatibility:  What if current apps depend on the flat directory structure?\n      Solutions:\n         a. Add a built flag to make this optional.\n         b. Deprecate the old behavior and ask people to change it.  I doubt many people depend on this behavior, and if they do, they are probably placing their resources in the root anyways, which would still function the same way.\n\nThis one change will drastically increase the potential for a third-party library eco system.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It does work in iPhone currently so it would be nice to make it work on Android too.\n\nIn addition to location permissions the following method of the WebChromeBrowser in the native WebView needs to be implemented to make it work.\n\nA suggested implementation (and the relevant documentation) is pasted below, but I also would like to know if there is another approach that works.  For this particular app a certain chunk of the functionality is in a web browser and this is the last piece that isn't consistent across the devices we are using.  \n\nImplementation:\n\n```\n    @Override\n    public void onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String origin,\n            GeolocationPermissions.Callback callback) {\n        // Always grant permission since the app itself requires location\n        // permission and the user has therefore already granted it\n        callback.invoke(origin, true, false);\n    }\n```\n\nDocs:\n\npublic synchronized void setGeolocationEnabled (boolean flag)\n\nAdded in API level 5\nSets whether Geolocation is enabled. The default is true.\n\nPlease note that in order for the Geolocation API to be usable by a page in the WebView, the following requirements must be met:\n\nan application must have permission to access the device location, see ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION;\nan application must provide an implementation of the onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String, GeolocationPermissions.Callback) callback to receive notifications that a page is requesting access to location via the JavaScript Geolocation API.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 14:21:58", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/802", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Geolocation API doesn't work in Android Implementation of WebBrowser"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 14:21:40", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 801](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=801) created by codenameone on 2013-07-24T17:53:26.000Z:\n\nRef: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/codenameone-discussions/ODcj1GSKN1U\n\nAs mentioned by Shai, on iOS CN1 transparently rotates a picture just taken by the camera to the 'right' orientation, but that behavior is not currently implemented on Android.\n\nSuggestion: could the API be updated so when we ask the device for a picture, we can specify if we want it in the &quot;original&quot; orientation or the &quot;right&quot; orientation?\n", "closed": "2018-02-05 13:42:17", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/801", "ttf": 1045.0002777777777, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Implement picture auto-rotation for Android too"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 14:21:25", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 800](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=800) created by codenameone on 2013-07-24T07:46:40.000Z:\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. create a new theme (blank and called &quot;Android Overwrite&quot;)\n2. select the theme, chose from Override In Platform: &quot;Android (phones &amp; tablets)&quot;\n3. click the green icon on the theme\n4. make changes to style elements\n5. saved it\n6. add following line in the initVars method in userclasses.StateMachine.java\nUIManager.getInstance().addThemeProps(res.getTheme(&quot;Android Override&quot;));\n\n<b>What is the expected output?

When I create a new Media instance of them and start the play() function, the instance starts fetching data from the server.\n\nThe documentation for the Interface Media says the following about the methods getDuration() and getTime():\n\n```\n/**\n * Returns the time in seconds in the audio file or -1 if not known\n *\n * @return time in milli seconds\n */\npublic int getTime();\n\n/**\n * Returns the length in seconds of the audio file or -1 if not known\n *\n * @return time in milli seconds\n */\npublic int getDuration();\n```\n\nBut all my instances return the integer 0 if I call getDuration() during buffering of the first bytes - before I hear a sound. Shouldn't this be -1?\nThe same applies to getTime() ... but there I can understand it, because the player hasn't started playing - therefore 0sec.\n\nCan you please change the value of getDuration() to -1 when the element is buffering? Otherwise I have to rely on that the duration is 0 while the metadata of the mp3 file is fetched and evaluated.\n\nThis is only tested on the simulator. On Android it at least doesn't return -1, otherwise it wouldn't call Media.isPlaying() - see #&nbsp;759 for more information about my implementation.\n\nI wasn't able to test it on iOS due to #&nbsp;755 ...\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 13:59:56", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/760", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Media.getDuration() returning 0 instead of -1 when instance reads mp3 metadata"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 13:59:25", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 759](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=759) created by codenameone on 2013-06-22T10:34:53.000Z:\n\nHi, all\n\nI have a class where I control the playing of media.

Yet my app consistently crashes. It seems that CodenameOne is recursively firing action events until it crashes. Works on Android and simulator\n\nI have a form with a ComboBox, a TextField and a Button. When the form is displayed, the keyboard is displayed automatically. The ComboBox is used to change the selection criteria, the keyboard collapses when you touch the ComboBox. After the user makes a selection the keyboard is redisplayed automatically. This seems to be the key. If I don't redisplay the keyboard after the ComboBox selection and the user touches the input field to bring it back, everything works.\n\nIf user brings up the form, types some input touches my button it works.\n\nIf the user brings up the form, changes the ComboBox selection, enters some text touches my button it crashes. The button actionPerformed is never called.\n\nIf the user brings up the form, makes a ComboBox selection, enters some text, then clicks Done in the keyboard, it works.\n\nI ran it under XCode and there was a long stack trace that seems to show recursive firing of events, my code does seem to be involved.

I'm using the pull to refresh feature to add components to this form. The problem is that when I exit the form, or even when clearing the form components manually on the fly, the memory allocated so far remains allocated and it seems is never released.\nThis is causing a continous RAM usage increase over the time (no much time) until the point the system kills the process to avoid a system crash.\n\nThis is happening as far as I've tested, from Android 4+. I ran a test on an old galaxy tab with Android 2.2 and it seems this not happens, or at least the memory allocation is very low per component that I cannot observe a huge RAM usage increase over a few minutes. Running the test on Android 4+ (galaxy s3 stock rom and AOKP JB custom rom) causes a fast increase on RAM allocation (maybe related to the theme) and never gets released.\n\nWith the attached project\n1. On the first screen just press the first button (no data required)\n2. On the second screen just press the first button (Man icon)\n3. On the third screen just pull to refresh to begin adding components. Be aware that I've detected a random NullPointerException on this feature, maybe a collision between the pull animation and adding components, so try to not pull so fast. Add 30+ components, so pull 30+ times for a noticeable RAM increase.\n4. Press the back key to discard the form.\n5. Realize no RAM was deallocated, or it was too little compared to the actual RAM allocated by this process.\n6. Enter again the third screen (step 2) without closing the application and proceed with step 3, 4, 5 again. You'll see RAM just increasing and never decreasing. If you repeat this long enough, the device will run out of memory and the system will terminate the application.\n\n---\n\nSample Project\n\n---\n\nUploaded to mediafire as is too big for attachment:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download.php?wpa509au1z4b94a\n\nIt's a very simple project so far but is very close to what I need to achieve.\n\nI've created a simple navigation controller based on &quot;Places&quot;, This is implemented in the Place and PlaceManager classes.\nA place is basically module of the application that may contain a form. It has a simple lifecycle management (launched, resume, pause, finish). A place is stacked by a PlaceManager, which is responsible for calling the lifecycle methods and to pop and push places from a stack. It's very simple, just a few lines of code.

Create a navigation form.\n2. In the properties tab, create a command via the popped up window. \n3. The example command created had an action of 'Main', and a postaction of 'main'. \n4. Reopen the commands window, and delete the command which was created. The button will disappear from the view.\n5. Switch to another screen then back. The command has been reinstated and is on the navigation bar. This happens regardless of whether you saved at step 4. \n\n<b>What is the expected output?

Instead, the button remains on screen with its original commands. \n\n<b>What version of the product are you using?

For example, setting a postaction to go to one form, reopening the command window and changing the form selected in post action, then saving those changes doesn't work. \n", "closed": "2015-03-27 13:10:19", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/598", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "GUI Builder not saving command edits.

then you would use Control-Click to achieve the equivalent of a right click.\n\nHowever, if you are in the GUI editor and you want to activate the content popup menu for a node in the Component hierarchy, Control-Click does not work.  Command-Click does work incidentally.\n\nI don't have a Dev environment set up to test the Resource Editor, but looking at the code I see that you are using SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton() to detect for a right click.   Evidently on Mac, this function doesn't behave properly for control-clicks.\n\nThis tutorial suggests using isPopupTrigger() for these sorts of things - I'm not sure if this will fix the issue.\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html#popup\n\nOther suggestions (from this Stackoverflow thread) include using MouseEvent.isControlDown()\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2972512/how-to-detect-right-click-event-for-mac-os\n\nThis is more a usability issue.  I stumbled across this when I needed to delete an element from the GUI layout and I was using my Macbook Air.  I couldn't find a way to do it because I couldn't get the contextual menu to open.  I thought, for a while, that I had somehow corrupted my resource file, but was happy, after some experimenting, to find that the context menu was just coming up on the wrong key.\n\nAdditional/alternative usability tweaks might include adding a top level menu (or at least some other way) to delete the currently selected element from the GUI editor.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:51:19", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/520", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Right click on node in Component Hierarchy of GUI editor incorrect on Mac"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:50:35", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 519](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=519) created by codenameone on 2013-02-01T13:27:44.000Z:\n\nWhen starting it (iPad 2, jailbroken IOS 5.0.1), I get a login prompt and once I've filled my email/password and pressed &quot;Login&quot;, the dialog reports an IO Error: java.io.EOFException.\n\nShai tried it too and got this behavior when entering a wrong password.

2013-01-18T03:52:26.000Z:\n\n(Present in trunk as I'm writing this)\n\nWhen renaming a gui element (like a form) via the Edit-&gt;Rename menu, it seems like the underlying model is not notified. As a result, the StateMachineBase methods generated in com.codename1.designer.ResourceEditorView at line 2389 are not writing accurate code. Closing and reopening the Designer doesn't help.\n\nHowever, if after that rename you simply modify any property of that GUI element via the property sheet (tab &quot;Properties&quot;), the generated code properly writes the findXYZ() when saving.\n\nI really hoped I would also be able to submit a fix, but I'm only starting to get familiar with your sources. I'll be happy to report issues and hopefully some fixes as I'm finding them. I feel the Designer is really an area I could help with.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:42:20", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/492", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "StateMachineBase not correctly updated after renaming a gui element in Designer"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:41:49", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 491](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=491) created by codenameone on 2013-01-17T20:58:24.000Z:\n\nThe BB 5 BrowserComponent disappears when transitioning into a form.\n\nE.g. the following will display &quot;Hello World&quot; briefly, but then disappear.\n\nForm hi = new Form(&quot;Hi World&quot;);\nBrowserComponent b = new BrowserComponent();\nb.setPage('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;', 'file:///');\nhi.setLayout(new BorderPane());\nhi.addComponent(BorderLayout.CENTER, b);\nhi.show();\n\nHowever, if I remove and re-add the browser component inside the onShowCompleted() event of the form, it shows up properly.\n\nI'm guessing this has something to do with the PeerComponent code in the BlackBerry implementation.  I'm looking through the createNativePeer() method and looking at the implementation of peer components, but, being new to BB, it will be a bit of a hill to climb to nail this down.\n\nI'm keen to hunt this one down, so any pointers or suggestions on places to look, much appreciated.\n", "closed": "2015-04-10 16:18:00", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/491", "ttf": 14.000277777777777, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-High", "Type-Defect"], "title": "BlackBerry 5 BrowserComponent disappears on transition"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:41:34", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 490](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=490) created by codenameone on 2013-01-17T20:52:53.000Z:\n\nBlackBerry 5 Browser component events (onStart, onError, onLoad) cause ClassCastExceptions because they send the Document object as the source of the event instead of the page URL.\n\nI have this fixed in my local version... will submit patch when I have sorted out a few of the other bugs. \n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:41:47", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/490", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "BlackBerry 5 Browser Events ClassCastException"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:41:16", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 489](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=489) created by codenameone on 2013-01-17T18:59:26.000Z:\n\n<b>Please clearly state whether the issue relates to a device/the simulator or</b>\n<b>the tools.</b>\n<b>If related to a device be sure to specify exactly which device with as much</b>\n<b>details as possible.</b>\n\nCN1 Designer tool\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. create a l10n resource in designer and try to export\n<b>2.</b>\n<b>3.</b>\n\n<b>What is the expected output?

(My testing is currently limited to JavaSE, Android, and iOS).  Currently, on JavaSE and Android, requests for URLs with the jar: protocol are handled by the default setBrowserURL implementation (in the CodenameOneImplementation class) which uses the getResourceAsStream() to load the contents from the local file and then set the page contents using setPage().  On iOS, the setBrowserURL() implementation instead converts the jar:// url to the correct file:// URL for the requested file.  The iOS implementation is preferred to the default implementation because is allows resources to be included in the page via relative paths in a manner that is consistent with external web pages.\n\nOn android and JavaSE, resources that are included (e.g. images and scripts) in the page fail to load because the relative paths are not resolved correctly when using the setPage() method.  This despite the fact that the 2nd parameter of setPage() is being provided which should specify the base URL from with to resolve relative paths.  The reason they fail is because the JavaSE BrowserComponent simply ignores the 2nd parameter of setPage() as there doesn't seem to be an equivalent functionality that we can tap into in the JavaFX WebEngine.  On Android it is likely because it is having problems resolving jar: URLs in the web view (this may be fixable on its own by trying to tap into all resource requests and remapping them... currently requests for webpages seem to be intercepted and mapped correctly, but not for other resources).\n\nThis can be illustrated with the following example:\n\nWebBrowser b = new WebBrowser();\nb.setURL(&quot;jar:///ca/weblite/codename1/tests/AddAsync.html&quot;);\n\nWhere we have the ca/weblite/codename1/tests/AddAsync.html file with the contents:\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;TODO write content&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;script src=&quot;AddAsync.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nAnd a the ca/weblite/codename1/tests/AddAsync.js file with contents:\n\ndocument.writeln(&quot;In Add Async&quot;);\n\nIf we build and run this example, the &quot;In Add Async&quot; line appears only in the iOS version.  It does not appear in the Android version or the JavaSE version because it is not resolving the relative URL in the &lt;script&gt; tag.\n\nI have attached a patch that changes the implementation of setBrowserURL() for the Android and JavaSE implementations with respect to jar: URLs so that relative resources are resolved correctly.\n\nI have tested this on JavaSE (in the simulator) and Android 4.2.1 (Nexus 7) and it appears to work properly now.\n\n-Steve\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:39:24", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/483", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "setBrowserURL for local files"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:39:13", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 482](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=482) created by codenameone on 2013-01-13T04:35:14.000Z:\n\npg 52: elemnt we &quot;show&quot; -&gt; element\npg 99: Gooles -&gt; Googles\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:39:18", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/482", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Typos in CN1 manual"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:38:36", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 480](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=480) created by codenameone on 2013-01-12T06:56:01.000Z:\n\nI have a problem that only occurs in my offline builds which is running off the SVN trunk.

However it is possible that my version of Android just handles this problem some other way.\n\nIn looking through the code, I realize that the getCookiesForURL() method that currently overrides the default implementation is unnecessary.  (I thought I had deleted this before the original patch, but I guess I left it in).  Since it is unnecessary (cookies are copied between the CookieManager and Codenameone as they are added to the respective stores... so no need to override), I have removed it (patch attached).\n\nThis patch also includes some defensive code to detect the IllegalStateException and create a CookieSyncManager if necessary.

(I have the same problem)\n# \n\nOn Android and iPhone if I setLocationListener when the status is anything other than LocationManager.AVAILABLE then it'll crash (Application closes unexpectedly provider==null and exception that doesn't seem to caught by try / catch around setLocationManager ). \n\nThe problem is that at least one of the Android devices we have reports LocationManager.TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE for both GPS disabled and current position not found.\n\nThis means that if it can't get an immediate position we can't safely set a listener to get current position (because if the position is unavailable due to location services being turned off in the phone settings the app will quit).\n\nThis is on a Huawei IDEOS X3 but has been reported to me by a number of testers on different phones.  On my Samsung Galaxy Nexus it allows me to set a listener without crashing when location services are turned off - but from 10 - 20 testers it seems to be the exception rather than the rule, most phones are crashing if the LocationListener is set with locations services turned off. \n\n```\n        if (LocationManager.getLocationManager().getStatus() != LocationManager.TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE) {\n            try {\n            LocationManager.getLocationManager().setLocationListener(new LocationListener() {\n                @Override\n                public void locationUpdated(final Location location) {\n                    Log.p(&quot;Location Updated&quot;);\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void providerStateChanged(int newState) {\n                    Log.p(&quot;Location State Changed&quot;);\n                }\n            });\n            }catch(Exception e) {\n                Log.e(e);\n            }\n        }\n\nIf I don't check for LocationManager.TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE then it'll crash when GPS is turned off in phone settings\nI would've thought LocationManager.OUT_OF_SERVICE would be a good fit here, but the phone never reports that status.\nThe phone seems to report TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE for both GPS turned off and when GPS is turned on but a position is not available yet (e.g., GPS only location services and phone has been powered off so there is no last known location).\nIf I do check status as above then the listener won't be set if locations services are on but not currently available.\nThe exception that is thrown and closes the app is not caught by the code above - that would otherwise be my next approach, attempt to set the listener and catch the exception.\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?  I have written native Android apps that use location services and they don't have this problem.\n\nRegards,\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:31:25", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/458", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "setLocationListener crashes when location services are turned off"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:30:17", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 457](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=457) created by codenameone on 2012-12-30T12:52:23.000Z:\n\nThe usage of the WebBrowser Component leads  (sometime) to a Crash on the iPhone 5 (not tested with other devices!).\n\nI tried it with some &quot;general&quot; URL's and it works fine.\nWhen i try it with &quot;special&quot; advertising URL's like\n\nhttp://partners.webmasterplan.com/click.asp?ref=000000&amp;site=8928&amp;type=text&amp;tnb=5&amp;diurl=http://www.voelkner.de/index.php?mp=products&amp;file=info&amp;WT.mc_id=affilinet&amp;ref=39&amp;products_model=R90915&amp;utm_source=affilinet&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=R90915\n\nthe application crashes.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:30:29", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/457", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "WebBrowser lead to a crash"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:30:04", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 455](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=455) created by codenameone on 2012-12-27T08:34:16.000Z:\n\nCurrently exposeInJavascript is not implemented on iOS.

(Thanks for adding that).\n\nI have come up with a small test program that reproduces this problem. The app runs fine in the simulator and on Android but crashes on iOS. When I get the source and run the app in XDev, the app runs but a GC Warning message is displayed at the point the app normally crashes. The I/O runs on a thread, it will display Done!! if it completes.\n\nThe line that causes the crash is: Storage.getInstance().writeObject(dbName, rows); \n\nThis app reads in a file from an external source, creates a Vector and then saves the Vector to local storage so that we have a local copy of the file next time. It will run pretty slow because I ripped out the buffering code I had in readLine.\n\nI have also attached two test files in a zip file that you will need to reproduce the problem. MobileTestDB.rw3.data is the smallest and the best to test with. Books.rw3.data is much larger, might be useful once you have fixed the problem for a bit of stress testing.\n\nWhen running this app in the Simulator copy the test file to one of your roots, i.e. C:\\MobileTestDB.rw3.data. When running on an iOS device you will need to sync the file using iTunes. The program will find the first .rw3.data file so don't put both there as it will find the larger Books file.\n\nI would appreciate it if you let me know what you find. I can continue development using smaller datasets which work. But if there is something wrong with my approach, then I will need to get started on redesigning it.\n\nThanks,\n\nMartin\nmwarnett@readerware.com\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:14:56", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/397", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "iOS app crashes after GC Warning"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:14:25", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 396](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=396) created by codenameone on 2012-11-19T15:33:45.000Z:\n\n<b>Please clearly state whether the issue relates to a device/the simulator or</b>\n<b>the tools.</b>\n\nActual device Blackberry 8250.\n\n<b>If related to a device be sure to specify exactly which device with as much</b>\n<b>details as possible.</b>\n\nBlackberry 8250 OS v.5.0.0.1036 (Bundle 1682, Platform 5.2.0.104)\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1.

I set up a multi-image. The recommended size in the GUI designer for a medium resolution image was 48 x 48 so that is what I used. This device reports that it is a medium resolution device so CodenameOne used the 48 x 48 image automatically.\n\nImg3 is using a 32 x 32 icon, better but it still does not fill the screen\n\nImg4 uses a 24 by 24 icon.\n\nSo maybe I should just be using a 24 by 24 icon but I think other icon sizes should display.\n\nIf I should be using a 24 by 24 icon, there doesn't seem to be an easy cross platform way to get it. I am using a multi-image and CodenameOne picked the 48 x 48 resolution image. It seems to me arbitrarily using a smaller icon in the multi-image might not work on other devices.\n\nI think there is a bug here, but if not I would appreciate any advice you have on how to choose the icon.\n\nThanks.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 12:08:50", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/375", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "iOS not displaying menus with images correctly on iPod Touch/3gs"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 12:08:23", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 374](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=374) created by codenameone on 2012-10-26T20:42:15.000Z:\n\n In my simple test I created a codenameone application using the &quot;Tab Application&quot; template.

These constants are used in BillingService at line 380.\n\n4)  Security.java at line 147 requires a public key.\nThere needs to be a way to provide the publisher public key or no purchase responses will be verified. Also, as per the online documentation, the string literal should NOT be included in the source. Instead it should be generated by possibly XORing 2 strings.\n\n5) purchaseDB private field unnecessary in CodenameOneActivity.  CodenameOneActivity.doInitializeOwnedItems is the only method that uses the db. The database should be created at the beginning of doInitializeOwnedItems and closed at the end of the function. Having an instance database field open for the life of the activity is unnecessary. Furthermore, this is the approach taken by ResponseHandler.purchaseResponse.\n\n6) ResponseHandler. purchaseResponse adds one to the quantity when purchase is refunded. However generous, this is incorrect. If this behavior is desired, it should be added by the app developer not by CN1.\n\nInstead of:\nif (state == PurchaseState.PURCHASED || state == PurchaseState.REFUNDED) {\n    quantity += 1;\n}\n\nWe should probably have:\nif(state == PurchaseState.PURCHASED) {\n    quantity += 1;\n}\nelse if(state == PurchaseState.REFUNDED) {\n    quantity -= 1;\n}\n\n7) Possible security issue related to storing the purchase info in the database. I believe that the product name (the sku) should be obfuscated before stored in the PurchaseDatabase instance. The importance that I see in this is that it prevents anyone from just simply copying the database file from one device to another or editing the database file to get free products.  The product name could obfuscated using the AESObfuscator class form the google play licensing code (I have attached the source for this) - this is of course just one way of doing this but probably the easiest.\n\nThe obfuscator uses a unique device id, the app package name, and a 20 random byte salt variable to obfuscate the values. The name of the product for each user is stored differently preventing copying or modification of the database file being able to spoof purchases. The name would need to be obfuscated in both database tables used in PurchaseDatabase and also used when reading the purchased items in CodenameOneActivity.doInitializeOwnedItems.  If this path is taken, there needs to be a way for the random 20 byte salt to be provided when sending an Android build. As long as the name is properly obfuscated it doesn\u2019t matter if you choose the google licensing AESObfuscator or use something else.\n\n8) Currently, BillingService.checkBillingSupported does not check if subscriptions are supported, only checks if regular in app purchases are supported. This is because BillingService.CheckBillingSupported class uses API version 1 when checking if in-app billinf is supported. To fix this, you need to alter the BillingService.CheckBillingSupported class to take a boolean in the constructor determining if it should check for subscriptions. In BillingService.CheckBillingSupported.run() it should pass this boolean to BillingService.makeRequestBundle.\n\nThis also requires a change to the CodenameOneActivity.CN1PurchaseObserver class. Basically, the first time you check if billing is supported, call billing.checkBillingSupported(true), which will check if subscriptions are supported. If this returns true (asynchronously), then both regular purchases and subscriptions are supported. However, if it returns false, then call billing.checkBillingSupported(false), which will check if regular in app purchases are supported only.\n\n9) CodenameOneActivity.CN1PurchaseObserver.onPurchaseStateChange method does not take into account refunds. I recommend this code for the method:\npublic void onPurchaseStateChange(Consts.PurchaseState purchaseState, String itemId,\n    int quantity, long purchaseTime, String developerPayload) {\n    Object app = getApp();\n    PurchaseCallback pc = app instanceof PurchaseCallback ? (PurchaseCallback)app : null;\n    if (purchaseState == Consts.PurchaseState.PURCHASED) {\n    if(pc != null) {\n        pc.itemPurchased(itemId);\n    }\n    getOwnedItems().add(itemId);\n    }\n    else if (purchaseState == Consts.PurchaseState.REFUNDED){\n    if(pc != null) {\n        pc.itemRefunded(itemId);\n    }\n    if(quantity &lt;= 0) {\n        getOwnedItems().remove(itemId);\n    }\n    }\n}\nThis allows the PurchaseCallback.itemRefunded method to be called and removes the item from the ownedItems set when  the quantity is 0. \n\n10) This isn't specific issue with the code but something you may want to look into. I'm not sure how canceled subscriptions are handled in regards to the messages to the PurchaseObserver class. CN1PurchaseObserver.onPurchaseStateChange method may need to take into account the CANCELED state for subscriptions, but I'm not sure about this.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 11:55:04", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/326", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Android Port In-App Billing Issues"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 11:54:24", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 325](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=325) created by codenameone on 2012-09-11T12:50:03.000Z:\n\n I would like to request one more method in the L10NManager class, which will allow printing the DateAndTime in small compact format.

However, there was only one instance of my main application. These multiple instances caused the memory usage to be very high (about 50 mb). In addition, when exiting the app, it took 9 calls to Display.exitApplication to finally get the app to exit.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the issue that I brought up in my discussion post &quot;Possible Memory Leaks in Android/Action Bar Errors&quot; were not completely fixed. Apparently there is now only one single static instance of the main app class, but that did not fix the issue with many activity stubs and implementations being created - which still leads to a serious bug and memory leak.\n\nI believe (and feel free to correct me) that in case of AndroidImplementation, there should only ever be one instance created. This is because it seems that AndroidPeer objects expect the same AndroidImplementation instance to be active when the app restarts as they access fields of their AndroidImplemenation outer class.  Currently, the way ImplementationFactory and Display work, a new AndroidImplementationis created every time the Display is initialized when the app starts. This will cause any AndroidPeer's already created to not function correctly (I think this was the problem in issue 312 that I submitted).\n\nIn the case of multiple activity stubs being created, this should not happen if the app is set to only have one activity by setting the launchMode to &quot;singleTask&quot; in the manifest.\n", "closed": "2015-03-27 11:50:54", "commitsDetails": [], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/314", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "commits": {}, "labels": ["Priority-Medium", "Type-Defect"], "title": "Android build creates multiple instances of activity stub and AndroidImplementation"}, {"created": "2015-03-27 11:50:23", "user": "codenameone", "body": "Original [issue 313](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/issues/detail?id=313) created by codenameone on 2012-09-03T06:44:31.000Z:\n\n<b>Please clearly state whether the issue relates to a device/the simulator or</b>\n<b>the tools.</b>\n\nThis Issue is related to both device and and well in simulator\n<b>If related to a device be sure to specify exactly which device with as much</b>\n<b>details as possible.</b>\n\nProblem is with all the platform BB,J2Me,Iphone,Andriod\n\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n\n1.The setMaxSize() does not work also problem able to type more char than mentioned .\n\n2.Another problem with text field and text area is when in designer a particular constraint say numeric  is set for the text field or text area then can type alphabets also \n\n3.One more issue reg text field and text area is problem with set grow by content once the focus is removed only then the text field or text area grows while the user keeps typing the text field text area does not grows .\n\n<b>What is the expected output?

I didn't debug CN1 BB port - it could happen if your code doesn't calculate deviceSide flag properly (or may &quot;;ConnectionUID=&quot; should be used, as HttpLib would add &quot;;apn=&quot; for this case, I think). I don't know, and my BB knowledge is very limited.\nThe connection was made via GPRS (BB 8310 doesn't have WiFi), OS 4.5 on board. I used CN1 build for 4.2.\nI have proper APN set in BB phone settings. My networking app (with HttpLib) worked OK even without ServiceBooks (I installed them separately few days ago to get access to BB features such as browser, but the app worked before that as well).\n\nI think that CN1 generates connection transport keys differently then HttpLib does, for this case (no BB services in carrier's network).

Create a ConnectionRequest class with code similar to the following code:\n\nConnectionRequest actReq = new ConnectionRequest() {\n                protected void buildRequestBody(OutputStream os) throws IOException {\n                    super.buildRequestBody(os);\n                    // Write the JSON object as UTF string\n                    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);\n                    dos.writeUTF(requestObj.toString());\n                    // Adding or removing the flush stmt does not make any difference in the error\n                    //dos.flush();\n                }\n            };\n            // Allow duplicate network connection request, as we will always\n            // send the request to the same URL however with different form data\n            actReq.setDuplicateSupported(true);\n            actReq.setUrl(&quot;http://som-server-url&quot;);\n            actReq.setSilentRetryCount(1); // Silently retry one more time before giving error\n            actReq.setPost(true);\n            actReq.setContentType(&quot;application/json&quot;);\n            actReq.addRequestHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\n            actReq.addRequestHeader(&quot;CLIENT_API_VERSION&quot;,&quot;1.0&quot;);\n\n```\n        NetworkManager.getInstance().addToQueue(actReq);\n```\n1. On the server side, you will need a servlet which can read the post request sent by above client code:\n\nInside the servlet, code the following to read the response(where req is of type HttpServletRequest ):\n\ntry {\n          DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(req.getInputStream());\n          HttpSession session = req.getSession(true);\n          String versionString = req.getHeader(&quot;CLIENT_API_VERSION&quot;);\n          String inStr = in.readUTF();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n  e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n<b>3.</b>\n\n<b>What is the expected output?

However when using the code in actual device iPhone (iOS), the connection request is received at the server, but it fails with the following error:\n\njava.io.EOFException\n\n```\nat java.io.DataInputStream.readUnsignedShort(DataInputStream.java:323)\n\nat java.io.DataInputStream.readUTF(DataInputStream.java:572)\n\nat java.io.DataInputStream.readUTF(DataInputStream.java:547)\n```\n\nAlso the versionString(CLIENT_API_VERSION) request header is coming out to be null when request is from actual device.\n\n<b>What version of the product are you using?

default in the generated xcode project.\nThorsten has submitted instructions for adopting the generated project file to ARM 6 support however making said changes into the generated project is difficult and the value could be dubious in terms of performance.\n\nThis issue is mostly to keep this within priority, we probably won't fix it for the public beta.\n", "labels":

This was caused by https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/commit/5c3174813a149da9865323285d877408c355bf29 which aligned SpanLabel text vertically centered with the icon by default.  The problem was that this was achieved using a FlowLayout with vertical center alignment, but FlowLayout doesn't fill the bounds of the TextArea to fit its parent, so alignment within the TextArea would have no meaning anymore.  Unfortunately there was no layout that would achieve the effect that I wanted (vertically centered, but filling the child bounds horizontally), so I added support for this in BoxLayout.\nBoxLayout now includes an align property that will cause children to be laid out with a particular vertical alignment.  Y_AXIS supports CENTER and BOTTOM values for this. X_AXIS supports CENTER and RIGHT values for this.  This alignment has no effect if the children fill the the container.  It is only for aligning the empty space.  With this change, I was able to use a BoxLayout.Y with center alignment to wrap the TextArea and achieve the effect that I desired.\nAdded a sample to test the regression which was provided in https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/2891.\nAlso added unit tests for BoxLayout which can serve as a sample and prevent future regressions.\n", "commitParents": ["001e1d980a942d9e8ac7463f57bea208ce2b4f62"], "spoonStatsSkippedReason": "", "commitHash": "78e0d4dadb04d1acff58efd9c1ac2005ba028700", "authoredDateTime": "2019-08-21 11:24:19", "commitGHEventType": "referenced", "commitGitStats": [{"insertions": 71, "deletions": 0, "lines": 71, "filePath": "Samples/samples/SpanLabelTestAllStyles2891/SpanLabelTestAllStyles2891.java"}, {"insertions": 182, "deletions": 1, "lines": 183, "filePath": "CodenameOne/src/com/codename1/ui/layouts/BoxLayout.java"}, {"insertions": 151, "deletions": 0, "lines": 151, "filePath": "tests/core/test/com/codename1/ui/BoxLayoutTests.java"}, {"insertions": 9, "deletions": 2, "lines": 11, "filePath": "CodenameOne/src/com/codename1/components/SpanLabel.java"}], "commitDateTime": "2019-08-21 11:24:19", "commitUser": "shannah", "commitSpoonAstDiffStats": [{"spoonMethods": [{"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.BoxLayoutTests"}], "spoonFilePath": "BoxLayoutTests.java"}, {"spoonMethods": [{"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.encloseYCenter(com.codename1.ui.Component[])"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.layoutContainer(com.codename1.ui.Container)"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.setAlign(int)"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.encloseXCenter(com.codename1.ui.Component[])"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.encloseXRight(com.codename1.ui.Component[])"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.yBottom()"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.encloseYBottom(com.codename1.ui.Component[])"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.yCenter()"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.xCenter()"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.xRight()"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout.getAlign()"}], "spoonFilePath": "BoxLayout.java"}, {"spoonMethods": [{"UPD": 2, "TOT": 2, "MOV": 0, "INS": 0, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.components.SpanLabel"}, {"UPD": 0, "TOT": 5, "MOV": 3, "INS": 1, "DEL": 1, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.components.SpanLabel.wrapText(int)"}, {"UPD": 2, "TOT": 2, "MOV": 0, "INS": 0, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.components.SpanLabel.setTextBlockAlign(int)"}], "spoonFilePath": "SpanLabel.java"}, {"spoonMethods": [{"UPD": 0, "TOT": 1, "MOV": 0, "INS": 1, "DEL": 0, "spoonMethodName": "com.codename1.samples.SpanLabelTestAllStyles2891"}], "spoonFilePath": "SpanLabelTestAllStyles2891.java"}]}], "url": "https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/2891", "ttf": 0.0002777777777777778, "gitStatsSummary": {"insertions": 191, "deletions": 3, "lines": 194, "gitFilesChange": 2}, "title": "Spanlabel's TextAllStyles Style not applied properly anymore", "statsSkippedReason": "", "user": "kutoman", "changesInPackagesGIT": ["CodenameOne/src/com/codename1/ui/layouts", "CodenameOne/src/com/codename1/components"], "spoonStatsSummary": {"UPD": 4, "spoonMethodsChanged": 15, "TOT": 21, "MOV": 3, "INS": 13, "DEL": 1, "spoonFilesChanged": 2}, "filteredCommitsReason": {"unavailable": 0, "moreThanOneParent": 0, "mergeCommitUsed": 0, "duplicated": 0, "multipleIssueFixes": 0, "alsoFixesPhrase": 0}, "body": "For a long time this has been working just fine.
