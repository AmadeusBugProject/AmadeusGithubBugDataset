Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this problem on the server using the still running same version and the exact same request parameters (14 via points in the Netherlands, point 3 == point 4)

There are more of these bugs in the last days but none of them is reproducible. The smallest one still had 2 via points. But it only occurred for the edged based CH it seems.
