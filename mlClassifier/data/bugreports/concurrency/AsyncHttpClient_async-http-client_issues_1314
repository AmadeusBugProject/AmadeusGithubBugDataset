ThrottleRequestFilter swallows interfaces
The ThrottleRequestFilter wraps the AsyncHandler with an AsyncHandlerWrapper. This way all additional interfaces implemented by the originating AsyncHandler get lost. E.g. ProgressAsyncHandler, ResumableAsyncHandler or any custom interfaces.

Suggestion: Maybe use a dynamic proxy which implements all interfaces of the originating AsyncHandler instead of using AsyncHandlerWrapper.
