NPE in DelayedClientTransport
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue.

### What version of gRPC are you using?
1.16.1 (but also appears to be present in master)


### What did you expect to see?
No NullPointerException in DelayedClientTransport.java

### Description
We (Firestore) have had a few reports of a NPE within DelayedClientTransport.java. (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/issues/428).

Looking at the stacktrace, it seems as though `picker` is null here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/57043233bf5aecce92f0c6629b6ac46d9393ce8c/core/src/main/java/io/grpc/internal/DelayedClientTransport.java#L149

Examining that function further, it seems as though picker is set here and here:
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/57043233bf5aecce92f0c6629b6ac46d9393ce8c/core/src/main/java/io/grpc/internal/DelayedClientTransport.java#L139-L142
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/57043233bf5aecce92f0c6629b6ac46d9393ce8c/core/src/main/java/io/grpc/internal/DelayedClientTransport.java#L165

In the first case, there's a null check that protects it, but there isn't in the second case. Should there be?

(All links to the 1.16.1 tag, but the code looks effectively the same in master wrt this issue.)
