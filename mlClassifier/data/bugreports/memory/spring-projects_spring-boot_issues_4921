Can't change html when using "spring-boot-starter-mustache" with Eclipse.
I want to use SpringBoot, SpringDevtool, Mustache, Gradle, and Eclipse on Windows10.
But not work.
1. I run as "Spring Boot app" at Eclipse, and Tomcat start.
2. I can change html in "src/main/templates"
3. I access "localhost:8080" by chrome browser.
4. I change html, then Eclipse error `The project was not built due to "Could not delete '/${projectname}/bin/templates'.". Fix the problem, then try refreshing this project and building it since it may be inconsistent` occurred, so "localhost:8080" return error.

Are SpringBoot and Mustache and Eclipse bad combination?

My build.gradle is ...

```
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
apply plugin: 'spring-boot' 

sourceCompatibility = '1.8'
targetCompatibility = '1.8'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.3.1.RELEASE")
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:1.3.1.RELEASE'
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-mustache:1.3.1.RELEASE'
}
```
