Sonar violation: "ThreadLocal" variables should be cleaned up when no longer used
https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=org.checkstyle%3Acheckstyle&resolved=false&rules=java%3AS5164&types=BUG

such code it is resulted in incomplete Multithreading implementation.
Violation looks valid.

Should we update code with execution of `remove` ? or remove ThreadLocal ? Or mark this as "Won't fix" ?
