AbstractChannel#filterOutboundMessage may mask writing a released empty buffer
AbstractChannel attempts to "filter" messages which are written [1]. A goal of this process is to copy from heap to direct if necessary. However implementations of this method [2][3] may translate a buffer with 0 readable bytes to EMPTY_BUFFER. This may mask a user error where an empty buffer is written but already released.
