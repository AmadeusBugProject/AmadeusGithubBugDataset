EdgeRouterFactory yields memory leak
The `GraphConfigurator` creates a new `EdgeRouterFactory` for every layout run:
```
algorithmAssembler.setPhase(LayeredPhases.P5_EDGE_ROUTING,
        EdgeRouterFactory.factoryFor(lgraph.getProperty(LayeredOptions.EDGE_ROUTING)));
```

The created edge router instance, say `SplineEdgeRouter`, is then cached within the `AlgorithmAssembler`. Since it's a new factory every time, caching is broken in `AlgorithmAssembler#retrieveProcessor`. 

```
if (enableCaching) {
            if (cache.containsKey(factory)) {
[...]
```
