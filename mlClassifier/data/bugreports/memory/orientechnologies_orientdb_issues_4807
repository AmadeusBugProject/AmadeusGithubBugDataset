Suggestions how to track down or solve memory leakage problem on OrientDb
We have OrientDB  version 2.1.0 in production (before were other versions starting from 2.0.8). 
Db is used as follows:
 4 to  5 remote clients are continuously pushing data to the database. 
There are around 88k inserts in hour. Records older then some date are deleted every 10 min.
The problem is that OrientDB eats all the ram (16 Gbytes) in about 4 days. Heap consumption is quite stable around 800 MB. So my guess would be that the problem is with the native memory leakage.

Any suggestions how to solve this problem?
