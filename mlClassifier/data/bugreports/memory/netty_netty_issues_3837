Did ChannelOutBoundBuffer need to remove NIOBUFFER threadLocal while the message is done
I found DirectBufferR is reference by ThreadLocal in the sender side even the message is already received by the receiver for a long time.
this problem is occurs in SPARK, which use netty to send block.
I not familiar with netty, or there have other solution to resolve that problem
