ElasticScheduler retains references to evicted executors
### Expected behavior
The internal `all` queue should be impacted by TTL eviction.

### Actual behavior
The `all` queue retains references to every single `ExecutorService` created by the scheduler.

### Fix
Remove from both `cache` and `all` during eviction.
