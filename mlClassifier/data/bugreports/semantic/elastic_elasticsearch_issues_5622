Clusterstate misses the cluster name as it's identifier
 Today the cluster_state is not associated with the cluster_name which is odd since it's pretty much it's only valid identifier. Any node can send a cluster state to another node today even if it's not the same cluster. These situations can happen rarely during tests or even in the wild by accident. The problem can occur if multiple nodes run on the same machine and they join multiple clusters. If node `A` from cluster  `cluster_name=a` shuts down while the other node `B` starts up with `cluster_name=b` and this node happens to get the same port on that physical host a third node that still thinks `B` is listening on that port might send a new cluster state. This can cause weird problems and we should discard the cluster state if the cluster names don't match
