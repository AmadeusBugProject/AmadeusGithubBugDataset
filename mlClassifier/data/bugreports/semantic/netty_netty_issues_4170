epoll force closes connection
a small (visual) regression when doing nio vs epoll: 

When _proxy_ is running on epoll, and the connection to backend is disconnected, the backend server shows a message:
Player lost connection: Internal Exception: java.io.IOException: Error while read(...): Connection reset by peer

instead of "Player lost connection: disconnected"

Any idea of what could be the cause?
(I'll update when I find the piece of code in epoll that could cause this regression)

random guess: there should be a shutdown() syscall before close().
where to look for comparsion: java nio socketchannel.close()
