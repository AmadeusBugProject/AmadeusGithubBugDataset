Entry set of read-only HttpHeaders loses original headers' ordering
**Affects:** 5.1.9.RELEASE

The entry set returned from the result of calling `HttpHeaders.readOnlyHttpHeaders(HttpHeaders)` does not maintain the original headers' ordering. This is a regression from 5.1.0 that I think was introduced in 5.1.1 in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/ce7278aaf4f20348862267c2081c20dc5bd77128. I believe the set is unordered due to the use of `Collectors.toSet()` which creats an unordered `Set`:
