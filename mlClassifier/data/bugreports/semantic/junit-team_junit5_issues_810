UniqueId.parse fails for methods with array type parameters
## Bug description
```
String idString = uniqueIdFromMethodDescriptorWithArrayParameter.toString();
UniqueId id = UniqueId.parse(idString);
```
will fail with `PreconditionViolation` since array types are described with an `[` in front but `[` chars are currently forbidden as segment values.

## Suggested Solution

Change representation of array types in `ReflectionUtils.findMethod(clazz, methodName, parameterTypeNames)` and `StringUtils.nullSafeToString(classes)`. 

Alternative: Don't use `[` as separator char in unique IDs. But some 3rd party tools might already have committed to the current format.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Encode `segmentType` and `value` in constructor and decode in `parse`.
