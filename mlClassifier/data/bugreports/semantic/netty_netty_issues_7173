NPE in cleartext upgrade
### Expected behavior
No null pointer exceptions

### Actual behavior
When an HTTP/1.1 upgrade request comes in, we call `onHttpServerUpgrade` in Http2ConnectionHandler.  This makes us create a stream, which eventually calls `new DefaultHttp2StreamChannel`, which is fine, except that it assumes that handlerAdded has already been called on Http2MultiplexCodec . . . which is always true except when we're doing a cleartext upgrade.

### Steps to reproduce

Make an HttpServerUpgradeHandler, with an Http2MultiplexCodec.  Send an h2c upgrade request.

### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)

Try to upgrade this to netty 4.1.15.
