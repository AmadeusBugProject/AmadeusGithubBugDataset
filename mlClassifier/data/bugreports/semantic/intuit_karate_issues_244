Cannot Parse/Validate XML if there is a reference to DTD
I have an XML response which contains 
!DOCTYPE USER SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/dtd"



and when I try to parse the XML it complains about DTD not being available.

Karate should be able to bypass the need for DTD to validate XML response.
