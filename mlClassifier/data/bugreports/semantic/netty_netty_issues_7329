Expiry strategy improvement request for DefaultDnsCache
### Expected behavior
Hostname configured with both IPv4 and IPv6 dns records. Netty dns resolver is configured to prefer IPv4 addresses, so I should always get IPv4 address.

### Actual behavior
but after several minutes run, it can only return ipv6 record.

### Steps to reproduce
Create a NettyDns resolver with DefaultDnsCache, and keep it running for several minutes. You can see finally only ipv6 record can be got.


### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)
the url have the issue is "mirrors.servercentral.com"

### Netty version
4.1.15.Final
