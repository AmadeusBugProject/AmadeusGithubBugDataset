Invalid Hispanic display name
In the following snippet we try to display Hispanic name in English:
```
for (TextWidth textWidth : TextWidth.values()) {
    System.out.print(textWidth + ": ");
    System.out.println(HistoricEra.HISPANIC.getDisplayName(Locale.ENGLISH, textWidth));
}
```
Output:
```
WIDE: Era de CÃ©sar
ABBREVIATED: Era
SHORT: Era
NARROW: Era
```
As shown in the output, the display name in` WIDE` width is in different language than English. In addition, in other width formats the display name (`Era`) is generic and doesn't seem to have Hispanic meaning.
