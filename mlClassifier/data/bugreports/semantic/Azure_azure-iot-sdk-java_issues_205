# Description of the issue:
Printout of "Lost connection to the server." is printed both to System.out and to log.
This makes it harder/impossible to suppres that output that would go to log with info level.

I found the message in 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/blob/master/device/iot-device-client/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/device/transport/amqps/AmqpsIotHubConnection.java#L769

System.out.println("Lost connection to the server. Reconnection attempt " + currentReconnectionAttempt++ + "...");
        logger.LogInfo("Lost connection to the server. Reconnection attempt %s, method name is %s ", currentReconnectionAttempt, logger.getMethodName());
---

My suggestion is to remove the System.out line
