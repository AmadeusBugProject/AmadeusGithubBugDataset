Using DatagramChannel.write(...) without bind the channel fails.
It's completely legal to use DatagramChannel.write(new DatagramPacket) even if its not bound. At the moment this fails with NotYetConnectedException in doFlush(..). 

This is because NioDatagramChannel.isActive() returns false if its not bound. The same is true for OioDatagramChannel. I think isActive should return true as long as it was not closed yet.
