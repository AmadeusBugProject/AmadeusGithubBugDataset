Restlet JAX-RS encoding problem - CRITICAL.
Guys Im testing migration from jersey and have tested few frameworks with angle of smooth workflow.

Restlet is a winner - most flexible, doesn't do any oddity with memory and server shuts down nicely.

However, embarasingly, its has seriosuly annoying bug:

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: URLDecoder: Illegal hex characters in escape (%) pattern [...]

```

It tries to double encode request parameters (I think its form parameters case or query) when used with standard jax-rs services.

None of other libraries has this problem. 

Is there a way it can be fixed any time soon? It is something it's been reported at 2.09 version... very annoying. 

I wish I can use Restlet but this bug is a deal breaker.

I know @Encode will stop decoding the parameter, but I need to decode it from url encoding...
